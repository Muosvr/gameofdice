## Basic Rules
1. Each player rolls and tries to guess how many dice there are in total among all players for a particular face value. Players can only see the dice they have in front of them, not what others have.
2. The next player have to up the number on either the face value or the number of dice count.
3. Face value of 1 is a wildcard that can be counted towards any face value.
4. The next player in order can choose to call out the last player that what he/she just said is not true, at this point everyone's dice are revealed counted. If the statement is indeed not truth, the player who made the statement loses, otherwise the player who calls him/her out loses.
